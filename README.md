# Chore Tracker
Chore Tracker makes getting kids to do household chores easy! A gamified child dashboard lets them compete with their siblings on a leaderboard, earn gold coins and spend those coins on rewards.

## Introduction

This was the final project on the 12 week General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp. I challenged myself to make an app that would be useful to myself and my family, while learning some more advanced features of React such as Redux Toolkit. I also decided to use Node.js / Express for my back-end (my previous projects used Ruby on Rails). I am pleased I made this decision as I learnt so much about making an API server and designing my data in such a way that it would work with a non-relational database (MongoDB)
